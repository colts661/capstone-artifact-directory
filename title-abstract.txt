Title:
Incomplete Supervision: Text Classification based on a Subset of Labels

Abstract:
Many text classification models rely on an assumption that requires users to provide the model with a full set of class labels. This is not realistic, as users may not be aware of all possible classes in advance, or may not be able to obtain an exhaustive list. These models also forced to predict any new document to one of the existing classes, where none of the existing labels is a good fit. We explore the Incomplete Text Classification (IC-TC) setting: Models mine patterns in a small labeled set which only contains existing labels, apply patterns to predict into existing labels in an unlabeled set, and detect out-of-pattern clusters for potential new label discoveries. We experiment with the potential of weakly supervised ML to detect class labels that humans may not recognize, thus facilitating more accurate classification. From the document and class embeddings and unconfident documents generated, we found that both the baseline and the final model had some capability of detecting unseen classes, and label generation techniques help produce reasonable new class labels.
